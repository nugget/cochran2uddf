# Cochran to UDDF #

This repository is a collection of tools and scripts to facilitate the export
of Scuba dive log information from your Cochran Gemini or Cochran EMC dive
computer.

The initial script will take csv exports from the Analyst 4.01 software and
convert them to a UDDF data file which can be imported easily into 
Diving Log 5.0 or MacDive applications.
